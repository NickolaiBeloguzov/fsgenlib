1. Get the input from the user [IMPLEMENTED]:
    - Total pool of people
    - Number of parties in a chart
    - Check if total pool is divisible by the number of parties
        - If it isn't, add a corresponding amount of people so that it will be divisible. Print the correction message after
    - For each party:
        - Name
        - Coefficient
        - Color (will be assigned) (optional) [ABANDONED]
        - Check that there are no dublicate parties

2. Sort the data [IMPLEMENTED]:
    - Get the data into its own DataUnit dataclasses
    - Initialize the Generator class with a list of DataUnit classes

3. Generate the data [IMPLEMENTED]:
    - Divide the initial pool into equal portions
    - Sort the parties by the decreasing order of a coefficient [NOT NEEDED, ABANDONED]
    - Repeat for each party:
        - Multiply the portion by the partie's coefficient
        - Store the result in the Partie's instance
    - Add all computed numbers and find the difference between it and the initial pool
    - Divide the difference by the parties number and subtract each portion from partie's people count

4. Dump the data into a .csv file [IMPLEMENTED]

Separate features:
    - colored output [DONE]
